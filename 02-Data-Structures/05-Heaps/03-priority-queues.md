# Data Structures: Priority Queues

## Priority Queue

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue>

An abstract data type similar to regular **queue** or **stack** data structure in which each element additionally has a "priority" associated with it. In a Priority Queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.

In some implementations, if two elements have the same priority, they are served according to the order in which they were enqueued, while in other implementations, ordering of elements with the same priority is undefined.

While priority queues are often implemented with Heaps, they are conceptually distinct from Heaps. A Priority Queue is a concept like a **list** or **map**; just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or an array, a Priority Queue can be implemented with a Heap or a variety of other methods such as an unordered array.
