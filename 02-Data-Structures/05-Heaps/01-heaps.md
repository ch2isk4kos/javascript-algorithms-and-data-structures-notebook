## Heap

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_%28data_structure%29>

A specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property: in a **max heap**, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a **min heap**, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.

Heaps are another category of **Trees** with additional specifications and rules.

They're are various types of Heap with the more popular kind being the **Binary Heap**.
