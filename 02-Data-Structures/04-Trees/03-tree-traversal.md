## Tree Traversal

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal>

A form of **graph traversal** - the process of visiting each vertex in a graph - and refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, **exactly once**. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited. The following algorithms are described for a binary tree, but they may be generalized to other trees as well.

Also referred to as a **treee search** or **walking the tree**.
