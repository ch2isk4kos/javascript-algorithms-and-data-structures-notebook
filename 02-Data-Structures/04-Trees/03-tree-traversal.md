# Data Structures: Tree Traversal

## Tree Traversal

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal>

A form of **graph traversal** - the process of visiting each vertex in a graph - and refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, **exactly once**. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited. The following algorithms are described for a binary tree, but they may be generalized to other trees as well.

Also referred to as a **tree search** or **walking the tree**.

It's a systematic way of searching nodes in a tree.

With a standard Tree, there are many different was of traversal. Two common approaches to traversing a tree come in the form of:

* Breadth-first Search
* Depth-first Search
  * In Order
  * Pre Order
  * Post Order

These refer to the general directions.

### Breadth-first

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search>

Checks across each layer of the tree from the parent down to the children.

### Depth-first

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search>

Checks down the tree starting with the bottom-most child and moves vertically.
