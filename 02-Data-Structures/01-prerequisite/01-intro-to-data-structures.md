## Data Structures

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure>

A data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely - a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or opertations that can be applied to the data.

Different data structures excel at different tasks. Some are highly specialized, while others - like arrays - are more generally used.

### Types of Data Structures

* Singly Linked Lists
* Doubly Linked Lists
* Queues
* Stacks
* Hash Tables
* Binary Tree Search
* Binary Heaps
* Directed Graphs
* Undirected Unweighted Graphs
* more...

If you're working with map/location data - writing a GPS application - and you're trying to route to a gas station with the cheapest gas, that'd be one situation where you would use a **graph**. It'd be hard to represent a map with a linear structure.

If you needed an ordered list - like an array - but you need fast inserts and removals from the beginning and end of an array. This is where a **linked list** would be beneficial.

If you're web scraping nested HTML or scraping data from a hotel website and interacting with that html, it's usually giving you that information in the form of a **tree**.

If you're writing an app with scheduled tasks, it would make sense to use priority queues with a **binary heap**.
