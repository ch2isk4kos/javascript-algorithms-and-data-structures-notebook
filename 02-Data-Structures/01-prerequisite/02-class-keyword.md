# Data Structures in JavaScript: The `Class` Keyword

---

## ES2015 Class Syntax

JavaScript does not come pre-built with any of the Data Structures listed in 01-intro-to-data-structures.md. You have to build your own. The `Class` syntax - which was introduced in ES2015 - allows you to create objects with predefined properties and methods.

JavaScript has never been known for its Object-Orientated Programming. OOP based languages like Ruby or Java use classes to model objects and offer inheritance with every instance created. JavaScript doesn't offer that type of funcionality with their `Class` keyword. It's merely _syntactic sugar_ and a way to define a class-like structure using prototypal inheritance but it doesn't change anything that happens under the hood.
