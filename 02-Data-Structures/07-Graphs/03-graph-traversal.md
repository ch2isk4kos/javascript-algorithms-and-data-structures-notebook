## Graph Traversal

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal>

Refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the vertices are visited. Tree traversal is a special case of graph traversal.

Graph Traversal deals with visiting, updating and checking vertices in a graph.

**NOTE:** a tree is are special subset of a graph for any given node there is **one** path to visit that node.
