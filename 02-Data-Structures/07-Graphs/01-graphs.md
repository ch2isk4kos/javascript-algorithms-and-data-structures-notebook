## Graph

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(data_structure)>

An abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics.

A graph data structure consists of a finite - and possibly mutable - **set of vertices** - also called **nodes** or **points** - together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an _undirected graph_ or a set of ordered pairs for a _directed graph_. These pairs are known as **edges** - also called **links** or **lines** - and for a _directed graph_ are also known as **arrows**. The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.

A graph data structure may also associate to each edge some edge value, such as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute (cost, capacity, length, etc.).

A collection of nodes and connections between them. No parent node or starting and end positions.

### Use Cases

* Social Networking
* Location / Mapping
* Routing Algorithms
* Visual Hierarchy
* File System Optimization
* **Just About Everywhere**

### Types of Graphs

* **Vertex** - a node
* **Edge** - connection between nodes
* **Weighted** - values assigned to distances between vertices.
* **Unweighted** - no values assigned to distances between vertices.
* **Directed** - one way connection between vertices.
* **Undirected** - two way connections between vertices.
