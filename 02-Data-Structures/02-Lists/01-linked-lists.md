## Linked Lists

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list>

A linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

## Linked Lists VS Arrays

A linked list stores whatever kind of primitive datatypes that come built-in. It's an ordered list of data but differs from an array.

With an **array**, each item is mapped to an index.

A **linked list** consists of a bunch of elements with no indices that point to the next element. In order to move to the 5th element, you have to go through all the other elements. The elements that make up a linked list are referred to as **nodes** and each node has a **value** and a **pointer** to another node or null.
