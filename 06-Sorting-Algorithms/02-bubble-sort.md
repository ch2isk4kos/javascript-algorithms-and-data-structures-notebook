# Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort

## Bubble Sort

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort>

A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through a colletion, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Sometimes referred to as **sinking sort**.

Not very efficent or commonly used but other algorithms which are more efficient are built on top of it.

```js
const array = [5, 3, 7, 2, 1, 9, 6, 8, 4];

/*

START OF FIRST ITERATION:

              [5, 3, 7, 2, 1, 9, 6, 8, 4]
               -  -

              [3, 5, 7, 2, 1, 9, 6, 8, 4]
                  -  -

              [3, 5, 7, 2, 1, 9, 6, 8, 4]
                     -  -

              [3, 5, 2, 7, 1, 9, 6, 8, 4]
                        -  -

              [3, 5, 2, 1, 7, 9, 6, 8, 4]
                           -  -

              [3, 5, 2, 1, 7, 9, 6, 8, 4]
                              -  -

              [3, 5, 2, 1, 7, 6, 9, 8, 4]
                                 -  -

              [3, 5, 2, 1, 7, 6, 8, 9, 4]
                                    -  -

              [3, 5, 2, 1, 7, 6, 8, 4, 9]
                                       âœ“
END OF FIRST ITERATION...

*/
```

Notice the **swapping** functionality.

### Bubble Sort: Less Optimized Solution

This approach is less optimized because it continues too loop over the entire array through each iteration.

```js
function weakBubble(array) {
  let temp = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
      if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
        // swapping functionality
        temp = array[j];
        array[j] = array[j+1];
        array[j+1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return array;
}

weakBubble([18, 2, 22, 4, 50]);

Every time you see `undefined`, the loop is comparing the last element of the array to an out of bounds element that doesn't exist.

The bubble sort functionality still works but it's extremely ineffient. Not only does it compare values that don't exist, it also compares intergers that have already been sorted making it a **needless comparison**. Could you imagine how long the process would take if you had an array of 50 elements as opposed to hundreds of thousands or millions of integers?

### Bubble Sort: Pseudocode

```js
// define a function that accepts an array of numbers as its input.
// start looping from a variable at the end of the array towards the beginning
// start an inner loop with a variable from the start of the array until `i - 1`
// if the inner variable is greater than the inner variable + 1, swap the values
// return the sorted array
```

</br>

### Bubble Sort: Solution

```js
function bubbleSorting(array) {
  let temnp = 0;

  for (let i = array.length; i > 0; i--) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i - 1; j++) {
      console.log(array, array[j], array[j+1])
      if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
        // swapping functionality
        temp = array[j];
        array[j] = array[j+1];
        array[j+1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return array;
}

bubbleSorting([18, 2, 22, 4, 50]);

### Bubble Sort: ES 2015 Syntax

```js
// ES2015
function bubbleSorting(array) {
  // swapping functionality
  const swap = (arr, idx1, idx2) => {
    [arr[idx1], arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]];
  }

  for (let i = array.length; i > 0; i--) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i - 1; j++) {
      console.log(array, array[j], array[j+1])
      if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
        swap(array, j, j+1);
      }
    }
  }
  return array;
}

bubbleSorting([18, 2, 22, 4, 50]);

// [ 2, 4, 18, 22, 50 ];
```

</br>

## Bubble Sort: Optimization

There is a very specific case where if the data is already sorted or a majority of the collection is already sorted, our solution above would still continue to compare the elements even though no swapping is taking place. That's a waste of time.

You can short circuit your code and check to see if on the last comparison, a swap took place. If it didn't, you can break out of the loop.

### `noSwap` variable

The `noSwaps` variable starts at `true`.
If you swap at anytime, `noSwap` is set to false through out that current iteration.
On the following iteration, `noSwaps` is set back to true.

```js
function fastBubble(array) {
  let temnp = 0;
  let noSwaps;

  for (let i = array.length; i > 0; i--) {
    noSwaps = true;
    for (let j = 0; j < i - 1; j++) {
      console.log(array, array[j], array[j+1])
      if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
        // swapping functionality
        temp = array[j];
        array[j] = array[j+1];
        array[j+1] = temp;
        noSwaps = false;
      }
    }
    if (noSwaps) break;
  }
  return array;
}

fastBubble([7, 2, 24, 33, 34]);

/*

=================================
         FIRST ITERATION
=================================

[ 7, 2, 24, 33, 34 ] 7 2
[ 2, 7, 24, 33, 34 ] 7 24
[ 2, 7, 24, 33, 34 ] 24 33
[ 2, 7, 24, 33, 34 ] 33 34

        SECOND ITERATION

[ 2, 7, 24, 33, 34 ] 2 7
[ 2, 7, 24, 33, 34 ] 7 24
[ 2, 7, 24, 33, 34 ] 24 33

=================================
              OUTPUT
=================================

[ 2, 7, 24, 33, 34 ]

*/

```

**Super** fast.
