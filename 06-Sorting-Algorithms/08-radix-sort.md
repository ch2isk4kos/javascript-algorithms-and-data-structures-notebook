## Radix Sort

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort>

A non-comparative sorting algorithm that creates and distributes elements into **buckets** according to their **radix**.

In a positional number system, a **radix** - or base - is the number of unique digits, including zero, used to represent numbers. In the decimal system, the radix is 10 because it uses the 10 digits from 0 to 9.

With Radix sort - also known as **Bucket sort** or **Digital sort** - for elements with more than one significant digit, the _bucketing process_ is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered.
