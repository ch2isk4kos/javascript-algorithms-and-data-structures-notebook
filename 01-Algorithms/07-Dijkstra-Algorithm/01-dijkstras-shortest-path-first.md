# Algorithms: Dijkstra's Shortest Path First

---

## Edsger W. Dijkstra (May 30, 1930 - August 6, 2002)

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra>

A Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, systems scientist, science essayist and pioneer in computing science. A theoretical physicist by training, he worked as a programmer at the Mathematisch Centrum (Amsterdam) from 1952 to 1962.

Dijkstra helped advance the field of Computer Science from an art to an academic discipline.

## History of Dijkstra's Algorithm

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm>

An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist **Edsger W. Dijkstra** in 1956 and published three years later.

Dijkstra's Algorithm searches for the shortest path between two vertices on a graph.

One of the most popular alogrithms amongst Computer Scientists and one of the more widely used algorithms to date.

**NOTE:** not to be confused with Dykstra's Projection Algorithm.

There are two _prerequisite_ data structures involved: **Graph** and **Priority Queue**.

### Use Cases

* **GPS** - finding fastest route
* **Network Routing** - finds shortest open path for data
* **Biology** - used to model the spread of viruses among humans
* **Airline Tickets** - find cheapest route to a destination
* many others
