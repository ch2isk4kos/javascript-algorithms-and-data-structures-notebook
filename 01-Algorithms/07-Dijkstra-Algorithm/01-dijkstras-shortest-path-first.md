# Algorithms: Dijkstra's Shortest Path First

---

## History of Dijkstra's Algorithm

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm>

An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist **Edsger W. Dijkstra** in 1956 and published three years later.

Dijkstra's Algorithm searches for the shortest path between two vertices on a graph.

One of the most popular alogrithms amongst Computer Scientists and one of the more widely used algorithms to date.

**NOTE:** not to be confused with Dykstra's Projection Algorithm.

There are two _prerequisite_ data structures involved: **Graph** and **Priority Queue**.
