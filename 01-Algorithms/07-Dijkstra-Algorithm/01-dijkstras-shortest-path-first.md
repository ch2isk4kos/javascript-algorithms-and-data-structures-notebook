## Dijkstra's Algorithm

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm>

An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

Not to be confused with Dykstra's Projection Algorithm.
